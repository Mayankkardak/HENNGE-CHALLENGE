###$## Hi my name is MAYANK KARDAK
I had a great time working on this challenge as part of the HENNGE programming task! It pushed me to think differently —
no loops, no comprehensions, just pure recursion.
I'm really excited about this opportunity and truly looking forward to joining HENNGE and contributing to such an innovative environment.

Power of Four Sum Calculator
This Python script processes multiple test cases and calculates the sum of the 4th powers of non-positive integers only.

Problem Description
First line: N — number of test cases
For each test case:
A line with an integer X — the number of integers expected
A line of X space-separated integers
If the number of integers doesn't match X, output -1 for that case.
Only include non-positive integers (<= 0) in the sum.
Sample Input
2
4
3 -1 1 10
5
9 -5 -5 -10 10

###Sample Output

1
11250

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
0 < X ≤ 100
-100 ≤ Yn ≤ 100
No for, while, or comprehensions used (recursion only)
Tested with Python 3.13+
Usage
Save the script as main.py and run it using:
